abstract: "An OpenMP-based shared memory implementation of the Parareal parallel-in-time integration scheme using explicit integrators is combined with a standard MPI-based spatial parallelization of a finite difference method into a hybrid space–time parallel scheme. The capability of this approach to achieve speedups beyond the saturation of the pure space-parallel scheme is demonstrated for the two-dimensional Burgers equation."
