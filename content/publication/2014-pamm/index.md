abstract: "The effect is investigated of using a reduced spatial resolution in the coarse propagator of the time‐parallel Parareal method for a finite difference discretization of the linear advection‐diffusion equation. It is found that convergence can critically depend on the order of the interpolation used to transfer the coarse propagator solution to the fine mesh in the correction step. The effect also strongly depends on the employed spatial and temporal resolution."
