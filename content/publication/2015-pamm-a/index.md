abstract: "In this paper we investigate the conservation of phase space volume of the Boris-SDC algorithm. This method provides ageneric way to extend the standard, second-order accurate Lorentz force integrator commonly used for charged particles inan electric and magnetic field to a high-order method using spectral deferred corrections. For a single particle in a Penningtrap and different frequencies of the electric and magnetic fields, we assess the conservation properties of the method bycomputing the update matrix of one step of Boris-SDC as well as its determinant. We compare the results to the convergenceregions and relate them to energy conservation properties of the method."
