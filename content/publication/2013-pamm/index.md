abstract: "The pole condition is a framework for the derivation of transparent boundary conditions that identifies non‐physical modes by the location of the corresponding singularities in the complex plane of the solution's spatial Laplace transform. A complex half‐plane is then defined that contains all poles corresponding to non‐physical modes. A key parameter in the pole condition arises in the Möbius transformation that maps this half‐plane onto the complex unit circle. The effect of variations in this parameter on the quality of the approximate TBC realized by the pole condition is explored here for the two‐dimensional drift‐diffusion equation with inhomogeneous coefficients."
